# Spool Meter Management System
Tracks spool material usage and uses the information to display the remaining amount of material in the spool and make predictions for when a spool will run out of material.

## Important Note 
Code will not work by itself as the server ip, database connection string, firebase json have been added to this repo. 
The embedded part of the project is also not included as that part was completed by my project partner, but everything in this repo was completed by me.
